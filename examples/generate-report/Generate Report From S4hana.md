# Weekly report generation on customer returns deliveries

This example showcases the use of `sap.s4hana.api_customer_returns_delivery_srv_0002:Client` for API interactions with
S/4HANA. It focuses on retrieving data on customer returns delivery items and compiling this information into an email
report, demonstrating an automated reporting process within the S/4HANA SD module.
